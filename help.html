        <h4>Set Search Location</h4>
        <p>
          First, to begin searching for local attractions, you must set your
          starting location to search from. Here are the various ways to
          accomplish this:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Drag the magnifying glass icon to a desired map location.</li>
          <li>
            Use the Lon/Lat input at the top right to enter in a desired search
            longitude and latitude on the map.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click on the magnifying glass icon and click the "Use My Location
            button" and then allow on the popup.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h4>Find Things to Do!</h4>
      <p>
        After setting your search from location, you can then set various
        parameters to find attractions in your local area. Use the +/- button to
        minimize/maximize (respectively) the search location parameters. When
        maximized, there are several search parameters to use to search for the
        most fitting location.

        <h4>Distance Search</h4>
        <p>
          Use this input to specify a desired maximum distance in miles for
          returned locations.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="indent">
        <h4>Location Type</h4>
        <p>
          First, select a main category for what kinds of locations you are
          searching for. After selecting a main category, the following
          subcategory input will begin to briefly cycle through corresponding
          subcategories, and randomly choose to search one. You can stop this
          cycling by waiting for it to naturally end or by clicking on the
          subcategory select box while it is being cycled through. You can also
          use the subcategory select box to specify a specific subcategory of
          your liking.

      <h3>How can I save a location for later?</h3>
      <p>
        To save a location for later, select the location and click the star
        icon at the top right to favorite it. This will turn the corresponding
        location marker yellow. Favorited markers will not disappear when
        location search queries are changed, including when the search marker is
        relocated. Favorited locations are saved across app sessions, meaning
        that closing and reopening the app will keep favorited locations.

      <h3>Can I still use the app if I lose Internet Connection?</h3>
      <p>
        While an Internet connection is required to initially load the map data
        for the app, if Internet connection ceases after successfully searching
        for a few locations, the app will continue to display cached locations
        that had previously been loaded in the current app session.
